# Face Emotion, Gender, and Age Detection

This repository contains deep learning models and Jupyter notebooks for detecting **facial emotions, gender, and age** from images or video streams.

## 🚀 Features

- **Emotion Detection**: Classifies faces into multiple emotion categories (e.g., happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc.).
- **Gender Classification**: Predicts gender (male/female).
- **Age Estimation**: Predicts approximate age group of the person.
- Pre-trained models for quick usage.
- Jupyter Notebook for demonstration, training, and inference.

## 📂 Models

All **trained models and code** are also available on Hugging Face:

```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/saifftunio/Face-Emotion-Gender-and-Age-Detection
````

You can directly download and use them from the Hugging Face repository.

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the GitHub repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saiff-Tunio/Face-Emotion-Gender-and-Age-Detection-.git
cd Face-Emotion-Gender-and-Age-Detection-
```

## ▶️ Usage

### Run the Notebook

Open Jupyter Notebook and run the demo:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/face_emotion_gender_age.ipynb
```

## 📊 Datasets

This project can be trained on:

* **FER-2013** (Facial Emotion Recognition)
* **IMDB-WIKI** (Age & Gender dataset)
* Or any custom dataset with facial annotations.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* OpenCV
* NumPy / Pandas
* Jupyter Notebook

## ✨ Future Improvements

* Real-time webcam demo with OpenCV.
* Better pre-processing pipeline (face alignment).
* Deployment as a web app or API.

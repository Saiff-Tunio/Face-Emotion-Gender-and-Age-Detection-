# Face Emotion, Gender, and Age Detection

This repository contains deep learning models and Jupyter notebooks for detecting **facial emotions, gender, and age** from images or video streams.

## üöÄ Features

* **Emotion Detection**: Classifies faces into multiple emotion categories (e.g., happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc.).
* **Gender Classification**: Predicts gender (male/female).
* **Age Estimation**: Predicts approximate age group of the person.
* Pre-trained models for quick usage.
* Jupyter Notebook for demonstration, training, and inference.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saiff-Tunio/Face-Emotion-Gender-and-Age-Detection-.git
cd Face-Emotion-Gender-and-Age-Detection-
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### 1. Run the Notebook

Open Jupyter Notebook and run the demo:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/face_emotion_gender_age.ipynb
```

## üìä Datasets

This project can be trained on:

* **FER-2013** (Facial Emotion Recognition)
* **IMDB-WIKI** (Age & Gender dataset)
* Or any custom dataset with facial annotations.


## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* OpenCV
* NumPy / Pandas
* Jupyter Notebook

## ‚ú® Future Improvements

* Real-time webcam demo with OpenCV.
* Better pre-processing pipeline (face alignment).
* Deployment as a web app or API.
